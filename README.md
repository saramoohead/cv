## Sara O'Connor

As a career-switcher, I write software from a user-first perspective. After a successful career in children's book publishing, I became a developer in 2015 and now have experience with enterprise-level software in procedural SQL, Rails and Javascript. I enjoy giving talks, creating events and doing demonstrations to teach publishing professionals, local children and their parents how to code.

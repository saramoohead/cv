## Sara O'Connor

After completing a highly selective, four month intensive coding course at Makers Academy, I'm an aspiring junior web developer looking for an opportunity to work hard in a learning-friendly environment where I can be creative and challenged. Prior to switching to a career in software development, I spent 13 years in children's book publishing, the last five leading on digital.

## Highlight projects

#### Makers Academy Visitors app

## Other skills
I work effectively with senior management to find solutions within budget, and communicate with respect and compassion with creatives (writers, designers, illustrators). The editor's job is to coordinate between the business and the ideas - and I've done it successfully over 200 times.

People compare editing someone's book to writing on their skin, so I'm well-versed in diplomacy, negotiation, prioritising change and searching for what people are really trying to say. I love to combine seemingly unrelated ideas into something new, and two such creations have generated revenue of over £1 million.

I've also been responsible for input and output of large data systems, producing endless standardised and customised reports.

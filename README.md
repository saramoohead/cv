## Highlight projects
#### Family Bingo Club - side project using Javascript (Meteor.js) - (completed September 2016)
Sole developer on web app to host bingo night fundraiser at a local school for all ages. To cater for pre-school children, the app called a number and a picture side by side. The second iteration allowed the boards to be the children's own images -- the site built the boards, optimised for print and then called those images with a description and artist credit. Now used three times, the web app has raised over £2000 for the school.

#### Made - freelance project using Javascript (Meteor.js) - (completed September 2015)
Sole developer on real-time chat web app, with integrated video as a freelancer working with Bold Creative.

## Other skills
Prior to becoming a software enginner, I worked in children's book publishing for 13 years. I work effectively with senior management to find solutions within budget, and communicate with respect and compassion with creatives (writers, designers, illustrators). The editor's job is to coordinate between the business and the ideas - and I've done it successfully over 200 times, making me an ideal developer who can balance customer and business needs in the code I deliver.

People compare editing someone's book to writing on their skin, so I'm well-versed in diplomacy, negotiation, prioritising change and searching for what people are really trying to say. Editing also requires outrageous attention to detail and picking through lines and lines of text - just like code. I love to combine seemingly unrelated ideas into something new - two such creations have generated revenue of over £1 million.

I've also been responsible for input and output of large data systems, producing endless standardised and customised reports, giving me an appreciation for the challenges of scaling code.
